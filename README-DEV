For testing in linuxcnc-dev you will need do the following

	Create a new branch named 'ncam', checkout that branch
	
	copy : ncam.py to ~/linuxcnc-dev/lib/python/gladevcp
	
	copy : hal_pythonplugin.py from dev/python/gladevcp  to  ~/linuxcnc-dev/lib/python/gladevcp
		
	copy : configs directory  to  ~/linuxcnc-dev/configs
		
	copy : *.glade  to  ~/linuxcnc-dev/share/ncam
	
	copy : README.md  to  ~/linuxcnc-dev/share/ncam
	
	copy directories : catalogs, cfg, graphics, lib, xml  to  ~/linuxcnc-dev/share/ncam
	
	no other files are necessary

	issue commands :
	cd ~/linuxcnc-dev
	. scripts/rip-environment
	
	commands in README.md for stand alone and embedded should both work
	However it is not meant to be usefull stand alone unless lcnc was/is loaded
		with the right SUBROUTINE_PATH
	
	open a project in examples directory
	Basic spacer.xml
	Fun wheel demo.xml
